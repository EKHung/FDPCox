## FDPCox: Cox regression under federated differential privacy

This repository contains the `R` package `FDPCox`, which implements the methods from the preprint [Optimal Cox regression under federated differential privacy: coefficients and hazards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19640). To reproduce the experiments in the paper, run `inst/experiment_functions.R`to load additional helper functions, and then run `inst/experiment_script.R`.
